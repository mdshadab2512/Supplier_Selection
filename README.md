# 🚀 Optimizing Supplier Selection using Machine Learning & MCDM

## 📌 Overview
Supplier selection is a **critical** decision-making process in procurement. This project leverages **machine learning** to determine feature importance and applies **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** techniques to rank suppliers efficiently. By combining **data-driven insights with decision science**, it ensures **objective, reliable, and optimized** supplier selection.  

## ✨ Key Features
✔ **Automated Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** 🧹  
✔ **Feature Importance Analysis using Machine Learning** 🏆  
✔ **Supplier Ranking with MCDM (TOPSIS, VIKOR, AHP)** 📊  
✔ **Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimal Model Selection** ⚡  
✔ **Data Visualization for Actionable Insights** 📈  

## 🔍 Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Reads supplier data, cleans column names, and removes unnecessary features.  
2️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Handles missing values and applies normalization techniques.  
3️⃣ **Machine Learning for Feature Weighting** – Uses models like **Random Forest, LightGBM, and Ridge Regression** to assign importance to supplier attributes.  
4️⃣ **Supplier Ranking with MCDM** – Implements **TOPSIS, VIKOR, and AHP** to determine the best suppliers.  
5️⃣ **Visualization & Insights** – Generates intuitive plots for better decision-making.  

## 🛠 Libraries Used
🔹 **Python** 🐍  
🔹 **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation  
🔹 **Scikit-learn, LightGBM** – Machine learning models  
🔹 **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
🔹 **Scipy** – Eigenvalue computations for AHP  

## 🚀 How to Use  
- Open Jupyter Notebook.
